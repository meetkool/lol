blizzard girl
2021-04-14

***

love will cost
me my sanity,
cover my heart in frost,
a warning I did not heed.

you come near
and I freeze in fear,
your palms algid, giving me
all the slightest provocation.

in life briefing,
I was told
to expect the cold
inherent in every human being.

but the soul council
must not have heard
of you, the blizzard
girl.

but the soul council
must have forgotten the chill,
the inevitable winter
after every soul splinters.
