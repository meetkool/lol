***

eat up, drink up, my children
are starving for sustenance
eyes rolling like a madman
trapped in endless raving trance

don't let it all consume you
like your ancestors have before
you despise walking on other's footsteps
stopping short of the golden door

save some for the little kids crawling in the back
they've been waiting for eternity
and will have to wait millennia more
for their turn to hear and see

call me when the roast is done
and I'll bring a hose with me
your flowers are at the verge of wilting
