crescendo

***

sweetness never stays.
no horizon is worth chasing relentlessly
ambition fades into obsession
and crescendos in devastation

a delicate ball of pure glass
wound out of the finest sands
twice shattered and once glued
can never be truly put back together

sticks and stones
may break peopleâ€™s bones
but scars dug deep enough
never truly heal

where is the peace I paid for?
surely my childhood doesn't hold a monopoly
although countless summer afternoons spent poring over
paper money counts in some convoluted way
