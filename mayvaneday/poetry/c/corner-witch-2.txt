CORNER WITCH II
2020-12-07

***

what would you lack
had you a magic cloak
that, come three twirls,
would turn you into a bird black?

the whole world would become my nest,
and I would roam the world,
never returning home,
not even at parents' behest

I wish that I could say
that that would be the end of my problems,
gaining mobility,
that everything would then turn out okay:

but I have not yet come to terms
with the fact I have too much baggage,
too many trinkets I would need to bring along,
unless I wanted to shrink my whole world down to a single worm

and while inside I may be an animal,
divine creature begging to break through my skin,
I must treat this body as human,
lest I break down and become unwell
