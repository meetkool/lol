CORNER WITCH

***

what would you do
with a magic cloak
that come three twirls
would turn you into a bird blue?

I'd escape out my bedroom window
and let the wind take me where it will
whether past the horizon or back to my windowsill
to watch the sky's fiery chariot plunge down low

but there's nowhere far I could go
no hope of bringing along my things
with legs like easily-snapped twigs
that bleed lost promises into the snow

and Pernicious does not as much sway
as the wind tousling the trees' hair
to convince me to abandon everything
and seek her bosom in hopes all will turn out okay

and what would Eternal Mother say when
I turn up at her door not to sing of her animals,
but to come one forevermore?
to abandon my voice, a sin
