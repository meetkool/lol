***

in the dwindling space,
suddenly it was unsafe
to from end to end let his feet pace,
the only race he could do was think
that soon the room would once again shrink

in the expanding bed,
rapidly convinced he was dead
from the burning in his body and visions in his head,
he clutched his pillow and mustered up a throw
to the floor to watch it become a plateau
