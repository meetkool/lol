forgive me, Marcel

***

being alive is the knowledge
that above my house, the full moon is pure white
but higher upstate, traveled at the wee hours of the morning
it's pink paper stretched over the frame of a kite

and the sprinklers watering the fields
rarely needed human supervision
casting ghosts like fog on the side of the road
fodder for a five-year-old imagination

the radios plead for us to wait for someone
but last I waited, I nearly withered away
the world unfolds before me in technicolor vision
congrats, you survived to a brand new day

headlights drag themselves across the highway
with sleepless eyes and desperate hearts
I wish I could show you in more colors
than purple and crimson apart
