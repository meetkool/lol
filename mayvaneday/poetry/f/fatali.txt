DEFILED
DEMURED
LOST IN CENSURE

CAST OUT
MADE BLIND
NO LONGER DIVINE

I WILL MARK MY OWN FATE
I WILL CHOOSE MY OWN PATH
OR I WILL GO UP IN FLAMES
FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE

AND AT THE EDGE OF ETERNITY
YOU WILL ASK:
WHO WAS I?
WHO COULD HAVE I BEEN?

If Neocities was paradise,
then I am Eve
from Eden, no longer beholden
for daring to believe
something verboten

and much like there, the fediverse is yet the same
being queer's the praxis, shitposting's the game
and yet we tear each up with our words
with misunderstanding
and thunder
like we've become animals
in yet another herd

you let blind anger run through your veins
consuming you from the inside
like a wildfire run rampant and free

you become like a damned animal
at the slightest provocation
a hellhound, made for nothing more than weeping
and gnashing of meat and bone alike

not fit for civilization
or wilderness alike
where do you belong? the air?
or on the end of a pike

you see a picture of your fave,
you click without processing
like an automaton
click, click, click

does this bring you fulfillment?
does this satisfy your soul?
a machine for someone else's validation
senselessly trying to fill a hole

is this the fate you wanted?
is this the end you meant to procure?
and if you answer yes:
are you really so sure?

begone, ye ghosts! lest you turn me
into a fictional entity I was never meant to be
I'll admit I've my doubts; I'll admit I've no sure mind
but in my life, this is mine and mine alone to find
