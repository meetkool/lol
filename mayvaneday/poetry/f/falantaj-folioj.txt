***

longer days, longer nights
summer was supposed to be our passage of rite
maybe I've got my words mixed around
I don’t think my head's on right

falling leaves, time to leave
everything you've ever known
and go farther away to get closer
it’s confusing, I know

I’m sorry that nothing has stayed
and everything has changed
you must feel so alone

maybe I'm just talking to myself

I press my hand against the walls of my new room
white and full of potential
I wonder what stories of the previous owners they held
I’m not a detective
