***

welcome to the edge of the world
where the souls of the dead come to rest
grab a stick and a boat
and wander down the river at our behest

don't mind the ghosts in the kitchen
prepaid to stay behind on earth
hands crossed on top of their chest
dehydrated smiles twisted in mirth

here, take these old bones of mine
I mounted them on the walls years ago
serving no purpose any longer
without their long-gone owner
