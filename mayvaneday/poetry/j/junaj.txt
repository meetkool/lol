***

there's something going on in the distance
can you see it with your wide blue eyes?
maybe that's a revolution about to happen
maybe just grand nothing in disguise

but you always had a superiority complex
want to save the world, don't you?
find problems in the system and throw yourself at them
until you become part of the problem too

we'll try to warn you at the final battle
you're not a hero; you're just a kid!
what are you doing, risking your life for people
whose allegiances are like the wind

if you're going to be reckless
at least bring along a treasured friend
two in the grave is always better than one
all the more for a sadder-to-write end

rest in peace to the other poor characters
no hero's funeral for them
