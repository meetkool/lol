***

kings are we
this band of three
our splendor gleams
for all to see

and we trek on
to yonder end
to greet the babe
in stable pen

some years with legs
some years without
lasered glass
or wooden cutout

Christmas lights
in constant prayer
ceaseless trek
up wooden stairs

every year
bodies grow smaller
featureless
Holy Mother

to ceramic slivers
we will all erode
no more gifts for
us to bestow
