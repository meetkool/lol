***

"Neutrality is taking the enemy's side."
But when someone quotes that, they usually
intend for you to comply.

So I dug myself a grave and called it my home,
and I forced myself to be content
with being with you alone.

And it wasn't until I'd been choking for a while
that my vision finally tunneled,
only seeing your smile...

Your grin, your gunt, your toothless embrace,
everything I am, you think
is yours to freely take.

And I don't know how,
but I found the strength
to dig myself out,

and the poison you denied was simply just air
never moved to harm me,
just sat inert there.

"A coward! A coward!" you call from the tomb,
but I'd think it more pitiful to continue
letting you give me more wounds.

So tell me,
why should I sacrifice myself
for your greed?

Are you anxious, restless, shaken, unsure
that the prison you've constructed
is truly your cure?
