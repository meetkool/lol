***

last time I checked, my eyes weren't a faucet
use something else to fill up your bath
surely that bath bomb you wasted $200 on isn't worth
making me a leaky pipe

little worryings that I write
on swirls of colors found at lakes
pink blobs of flowers scream to only my ears
"what if you get sick of me?"

maybe they're insane
but I'm not sure who "they" are
maybe it's a ghost of a past me
laughing herself into obscurity

drugs advertised on billboards on the side of the road
tapping my fingers on the steering wheel
just two hours away from your sleeping body
two hours away from the end
