***

as a woman, everyone
thinks I'm a mess,
that I must be embroiled
in some bitter distress
because I wear no makeup,
do not clothe myself in a dress,
and laugh at those who
seek to make themselves less

*Sweetheart, sugar pumpkin,*
my grandmother would croon,
despite my pleading that
I be immune
to being dolled up,
I, rough, unhewn,
secretly in love with
the girl in the moon
