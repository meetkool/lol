"I'd rather sink than swim."
but I'd never take advice from *him*
no matter how charming are his wiles
no matter how shiny his eyes, or how he beguiles

but every day I stand on Darkness' shore
the void which entreats me to live for my own sake no more
and take up someone else's cross, no longer society's sore

"Don't you want to stop being alone?"

lost limbs, lost sight, voyeuristic clothes
family taking on countenances I'd rather have for my own
submission as a plaything to powerful men
no jaw to smile as I bring about my own end

but you pull me back, away from the mire
you who entreat me to place my own happiness higher
sing in the depths of the terror-filled night-
how I adore you, dear child of light!
