***

think of the beauty left around you
consumed by urban monsters
and dissolved in ashes
from burned-down skyscrapers

the shadow sitting next to me on the train seats
tastes like charisma with a whiff of perfume
I cannot exist in two places at once
I cannot exist and let you have me too

I'll try to write you letters from where I am going
but I make no promises, especially nowadays
and anyways, the bumpy ride would smudge the letters
making all a haze

tonight is a blank canvas
upon which I'll be swept away
so please take down the empty portrait
of me hanging in your hallway

going, going, gone
