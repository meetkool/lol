la somero de amo
2016-06-12

***

they say that the end is coming sooner
but the end is already here
with lunatics standing with clapboards affixed to their chests
and chaos in the school hallways

it was the summer of '16
we called it the summer of love
because flowers grew from the gardens in our souls
and bloomed to the everloving sky

the only end that's closing around us soon
is the end of the school year
and that's already passed by uneventfully
with a sizzle instead of a bang

these next three months are a brown seed
that I hold inside of my pale hands
this could either be a summer of love
or a summer of storms

your choice
