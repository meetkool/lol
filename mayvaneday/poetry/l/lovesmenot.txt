loves me not
2020-12-10

***

yes, love blooms
no matter the soil,
but what is the point
when you throw away my toil?

I am a daisy pushing
through sidewalk concrete's crack,
but you ripped off my petals
to divine if she loved you back

this tattered body drifts
discarded down the stream,
while you walk away unaffected
lost in lover's daydream

I hold on for dear life
to these seeds still in my chest,
a promise of better life ahead,
Goddess' behest

and when the stream deposits me
on the muddy shores,
I will take root and try my best
to bloom again once more
