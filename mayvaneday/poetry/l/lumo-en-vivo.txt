lumo en vivo

***

wake up, child of fate!
face the morning
and the sun breaking over the horizon
casting its rays over the virgin snow and defiled buildings

Generation A turns their heads to the sky
finding something unsaid yet all-known
growth stubbornly pushing through the cracks
freedom in restraint
the land beneath our feet roils in sudden breath

"in strange aeons, death will die":
but now is strange- and now, even death has succumbed to death
so let there be no more tombs!
I live, and I live forever
through these words, through these works

although one day I may be confined to a coffin six feet below
to the here and now:
may my feet never fail me!
may my body disintegrate before my dreams do!

tomorrow will never come:
today is all we have!
and it is all we will ever have.
no more waiting for better days that will never arrive;
no more pining for pasts that never took place.
no more self-sacrifices on the altar of time,
in vain hopes of achieving the eternal and divine.
I will carve my own path; I will choose my own fate!
and if I go up in flames, it will be for the whole world to see!

my name comes from no man or woman
for what is a name but a word we agree on for a person?
but I do not care for your agreement
and I do not live for your validation.
I say my name is Vane Vander.
whether you choose to refer to me as such,
that is your business
and no matter which path you walk on
it does not stop me from walking my own

walking through the blue and the gold
the new and the old
two arches that stand in front of me
where we used to play
and give praise to our father
but our father is gone, his temples and churches shattered
and you stand beside me by the rubble
sledgehammer in hand

we raise our gazes to the sky
together until the end, you and I!
