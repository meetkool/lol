***

the cathedral's bells ring
horseshoe mounted above the doorframe
from the pastor's mouth drip words:
"confess and you shall be made whole"

you stand at the pulpit
and proclaim to the congregation
how holy you are,
that you have rescinded control

baptized in the claps,
reborn as a shriveled
ghost of who you once were:
a person without a soul

bloat as original sin
that one needs to be absolved of,
leaving behind the colors and joys
beyond these gated walls

"out yonder lives the devil
with his malice and malware and pain;
'tis an illusion that, beyond the wiles,
he helps those alive stand tall"

one in a sea of faceless
made faceless yourself
give your soul to the gods
put your heart on the shelf

a landscape of white
and a monotone hum
to spill your own blood
earns a trip straight to hell
