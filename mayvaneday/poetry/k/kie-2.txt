kie ajn vi estas, parto du

***

somewhere on the other side of the world
you hold a little sliver of me in your chest
wedged by your heart through a thousand battles
survived not one less

and I, you, the same
but at home, I feel the pain
of transmitted burdens,
wings soaked with rain

somewhere on the other side of the world
I hold a little sliver of you in my soul
but even through dimensional curtains,
your warmth can't beat the cold

and I worry that, one day
two aliens will show up at my bedroom door
signaling even before they knock
that you'll come home nevermore

we met each other in a winter haze
not twenty-four hours before final-failing pain
but you didn't care, whisked through dark gates
barely five minutes passed; several weeks next to wait

and I tumbled into love, burning hot as hell
as I tumbled down deep into war's well
when will it all end? nobody can say
to protect you, only to fictional gods can I pray
