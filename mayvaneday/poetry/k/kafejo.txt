***

every morning after a short drive to the coffee shop
he ordered the exact same thing in the exact same size
so when he decided to diverge from his norm
and order a smoothie in a smaller size
and the world decided then to crumble
he couldn't help but think that it was his fault

he couldn't help himself
he loved the way that the barista's plump lips
shone like a freshly washed apple and just as round
when they moved over the sound of his order

he sat at the little table by the window
and sipped at the smoothie as the sky darkened
the air tingled with lightning to come
the injured girls whimpered with the pressure

the barista's blood wasn't quite as red as her lips
but as she winced and wiggled her fingers to tbe trembling ground
they dripped a faint rusty color
someone here's not human
