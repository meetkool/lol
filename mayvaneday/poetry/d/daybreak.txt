***

the wind and fresh air feel good on my skin
and a strange happiness fills my heart
as if everything will be alright
and the world is beginning again

last I sat here was at the apocalypse
wondering if the world would ever be okay since
and while the past few months have been a strain,
everything will wash away in the rain

Vane of three years ago, give me a sign
because I've been feeling you smile through the chasm of time
did you know this would happen? is this why you wrote
that the only real future was the one that you chose?

a shredded leaf sits at my feet
a relic from a time when thoughts were replete
and I sit here in silence, wind at my back
and a spirit from another world at my side

rain comes from snow, and puddles from ice
and crows in the sky, and ground filled with mice
and ants from the air, like a god's springtime scourge

this is a place I might never see again
like that basement where I met my first alien friend
dear arboretum, from cradle to grave,
pray to whatever god you believe in, that my soul they might save
