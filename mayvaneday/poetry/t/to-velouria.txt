To Velouria
2020-12-17

***

I do not wish to poison
the waters between me and you,
but my heart yearns to withdraw,
to seek solitude

to turn my back on
the world that you've made,
to sit at the lake's shores
and watch the ducks play

this reed-filled bank
I know I can never return to,
can never trespass,
only pass through

on a hot buggy day,
sun glaring in my eyes
as I shake a spanning tree
for apples for a pie

I know I possess
power in my soul,
a world without end,
a universe I hold

made by my weary hands
from twelve to twelfth grade,
to beyond the vale,
somewhere past the glade

the bees in the buds
and the birds in the sky:
I envy them all as they
so carefree-ly fly

everything with a pair,
every one in its place
but hyper-atomist me stuck
seeking false grace

dear Velouria, I wonder:
why do you ask
a miracle from me,
an impossible task?

to sever the last umbilical cord
and be truly Sole and One,
but I cannot bring myself to destroy
all that I've become

I would much rather live
without the burden of your laws,
a life of my own,
a world with no need for gods

I do not wish to poison
the ocean that I am;
my heart must beat on,
even if my course is ran
