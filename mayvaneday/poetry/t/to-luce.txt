To Luce
2020-04-03

***

barrelling headfirst into a storm yet unknown
where surely the seeds of my fate will be sown,
I stand at my window and I watch and I wait
and think of those who would dare defy fate.

why should I accept my own alienation?
it's not as if there was ever any "nation"
that would welcome me in with cries of godsends
while speeding along nature's chrome-plated end.

am I to accept this life of duality, severed in two
while denying a part of me- was *you?*

stumbling out of the ward, covered in stitches
where once Father speared me and spilled all of my wishes
onto hell's floor

this can't be my future,
for my heart yearns for more

Luce, I swear to you as you sit up on high,
I will make it out of this hellhole alive.
