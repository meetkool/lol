***

your scarf is a snake
wrapping around your throat
delivering a simple message from me
knit into the strands for all to see

"run"

are you ready to cross the divide?
your key doesn't fit this doorknob
shed your skin and step into the chilly air
with soft skin and a brand new heart

do you wish you were a watch
so that when your core breaks
you could just go into a repair shop and get some replacements?
but then I'd have to wind you up every day

and if there's one thing I'm really good at
it's getting people angry
