Somnolence
2020-10-25

***

to be a young child again, forced outside
in a bare backyard with nowhere to hide
and scrape the ground's skin, past Gaia with wiles
and dead skin cells that we shape into piles

the sky far above is baby powder blue
neighbor to gray, somnolent hue
the blanket draped over a loop of time
sheer thin veil between me and divine

moon like an eye that I hold in my palms
Nyx's guidance, a past world in the calm
watching the branches rake past Selene's glow
as above, truly, shall it be below

this is the weather that speaks to my soul,
that comes with sharp needle to stitch shut the hole
and I bite wooden block, half-empty spirit glass,
and remind myself that this too shall pass
