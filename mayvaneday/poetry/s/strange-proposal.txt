A Strange Proposal
2021-07-07

***

How do you talk someone out of a self-destructive dream?
How do you convince the one you love that it seems
that, even though they have your love, you know they walk the line
between life and death and, come misstep, will perish before their time?

I have convictions too,
but they're not very strong.
I'm a tree.
Firmly taken root,
swaying
as the wind pleases
yet never breaking
in my base belief
that, even though it all, I don't want to cease
but instead find a quiet place
guaranteed to bring me wherever-needed peace.

I don't want you to lift your head,
bloodied, war-torn,
and choose oblivion over admitting defeat.

I want you to create a world with me.
