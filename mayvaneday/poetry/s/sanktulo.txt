I could use a light in the dark
past the dimmest streets between posts
maybe you should look to your right
that house is where you used to play host

sneaking out late at night
to visit friends who soon wouldn't be at all
do you remember my face? my scars?
don't worry; the forgetting's mutual

this whole place feels so surreal
that sometimes I question
if my childhood was real

and if I don't let go of these rusty playground poles
they won't hesitate to rip in me a hole
