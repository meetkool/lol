Sweet Summer
2020-12-16

***

your dress flaps in the wind like a honeysuckle breeze,
reminding me of long since devoured butterscotch dreams
with your sapphire eyes upturned to the sky
and summer's hazy love on your mind

your smile is like the finest wine,
an intoxication that I wouldn't mind wandering in,
but my heart would give out if in wonder for too long
and even the brightest flowers fade after a while

the warmth of your skin,
the sweet scent of your hair,
all entreat me to spend a while there.
but the tornado comes, uninvited, and tears up the earth
and I wish it was summer again on this desolate earth
