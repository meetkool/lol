Sedation In Alliteration
2021-01-21

***

Dilly decided that I must die
and when I waited for a why
she simply sighed

Terry trapised onto the stage
his rifle filled with sudden rage
towards my rib cage

Mary might be making me mad
by destroying the diamonds dyad
given to me by my great-grandad...

regardless of the rain,
my soul will simply
go on.
