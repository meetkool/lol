prayer to dark
2018-05-15

***

we were born in the summer rain
the segway to autumn on the horizon
pit-pattering on an old womanâ€™s kitchen windowsill
her own rain carving timeless canyons in her skin

I never put much stock in the seven deadly sins
until greed became my downfall
and I traded my wings, my flight, my freedom
for a measly amount of human gold

instant regret

hair sopping in the rain
I picked myself up and pushed past the searing pain
ribbons of ripped flesh still hanging off my back

we turned our eyes away from the light
so hard that we forgot how to see
so we built our own heaven
you and I, you and me

together until the end
