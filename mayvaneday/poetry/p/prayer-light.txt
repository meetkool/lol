prayer to light
2018-04-19

***

planned obsolescence
learned helplessness

a window randomly swings open
a door suddenly slams shut
an escape hatch forms

we trained our eyes to see the light
never bothering to look ahead to the darkness under our feet
the filth growing beneath the surface
bubbling as it primes itself for betrayal

we turned our faces to the sky so hard
that we broke our own necks
a pitiful penance for the sins of our fathers
and a wasteful protection against the suffering of our children

the connection to the heavens has been severed
and we shall build our own ladder
our own hands reaching to the sky
