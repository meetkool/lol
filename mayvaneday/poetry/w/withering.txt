***

I love it when your eyes
are lost in the city lights
unaware of my impending demise
just driving along on another sparkling night

just another day in paradise
where sloth somehow isn't a vice
and the days pass by faster than I can count
hours pass without a single sound

no more time to lose
as I grieve alone in my room
who am I? do you know
or did it all wash away in the snow
