***

I stand at the edge of the void and I scream
"isn't there any hope left for me?"
no response, just as I expected
just a drop in the sea and my own damn reflection

something in the water starts to swirl
the boat rocks- and I think I might hurl

all the words I spat up as a babe three years hence
before I decided to look over the fence

and as I turn my head to the sky, what should I see
but my muses, heads and bodies numbering three

"we knew what would happen.
why didn't you listen?
you could have avoided
your own perdition.

now get up and start taking life into your own hands.
for too long, you've cast your gaze at unattainable lands.
your name's not Lucine- or Seliph, or Chiki.
what you are comes from inside of you, not from a screen.

remember, you don't have to ask permission to *be*.
to breathe, to move, to choose what you believe.
your name is your own, regardless of those you call 'friends'.
damn their approval! it won't matter in the end.
those who matter will know when to clap,
and the rest will all blow away in the never-ceasing wind like chaff.

we know you're penning these words to convince yourself.
so as long as you have the reins and your brain's on the shelf:

you exist, no matter what other people say.
you make a mark on the world in your own special way.
maybe it's hidden, maybe it's obscure-
but unless you live as yourself, you'll never know for sure."
