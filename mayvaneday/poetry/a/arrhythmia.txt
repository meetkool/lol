Arrhythmia
2021-04-01

***

When a person gives
you arrhythmia,
you may want to write a love poem.

That is,
if you don't die of
a heart attack first

or feel the
implosion of a
vessel burst

in your brain
from a would-be lover
driving you insane.

When a person gives
you a stroke,
you may want to paint a sunset.

That is,
if you don't drop
the brush first,
if you don't spill the paint
onto the floor
from a misplaced curse of
silence forevermore.
