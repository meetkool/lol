a royal color

My grandmother has
a room in her house
dedicated to purple.
Lavender walls,
royal sheets:
I'd only need
you there
for it to be complete.
For eyes are the windows
into the soul,
windows I have spent many a childhood
gazing out onto the cold
dead suburban landscape.
How I wish I could take
you into my arms
and let you teach
this worn-out teacher
there is still warmth
worth searching for.
