***

wandering across the blank expanses
it's midnight, illuminated by faint glows
am I somebody's guardian angel
or the devil
standing at the gateway to happiness?

I've seen enough scars to last a lifetime
scarlet and crimson flowing into a sink
I would shriek for the sources to stop, to save themselves
but they've dug a hole and drowned themselves in

where are your parents?
I'd like to pass them a little letter
"your daughter is in a dark place right now
and needs not the falsely validating lure of a faceless crowd
but the love of those she's grown up around"

blame is a hard thing to pinpoint here
do I blame the supposed victim for caressing
the poisonous grip of little red hearts
or the parents, oversight failing tremendously
this is your flower, your garden wilting
whereâ€™s water when you need it?
