***

The pendulum swings yet again back and forth
as I ask you the millionth time and one more
if you still love me, still tolerate
my existence, are sure towards me
you hold no sliver of anger or hate.
Because we've made these vows so many more times,
but I'm forbidden by my anxiety
from failing to plan for any contingencies.
Like I'm my father now,
I myself with questions hound:
"Well, now you're twenty-two,
and I don't want to seem like I'm forcing you
to come along with me."

Angel numbers meet at midnight's bend.
"For you, you'll never see me again."
But Jett, does it work the other way?
If I ask you to, will you forever stay?
Will you swear yourself in health and sickness to my lonely side?
Will you in this new world I am creating reside?

Because, you should know,
if you willed it,
I would gladly disappear.

Go, if you must,
without fear.
I will be here
at the end of every day
to reclaim
that which was only ever mine.
