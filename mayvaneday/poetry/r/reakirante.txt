one

I'm a little bit lost without you
eyes replaced by flowers
growing and spreading all over my face
these roses blush harder than I do

If love were a place
all I'd be able to do is leave
it's a fleeting feeling
this beating in my chest

sea foam runs in my veins
I speak the language of waves
and my feet drift along the beach shore
guided by ghosts whispering in the ocean spray

maybe I am a machine
and I'm malfunctioning from the moisture
got some "genderfluid" in my heart
and some "androgyne" in my gears


two

I'd rather be hurt by the truth
than laid softly into a bed of lies
falsities brushing against my forehead like falsities
whispering trivialities that later crumple

the dandelions hanging above my bed
are not taking preservation well
they just wilt and whimper to be set free
from swaying softly in the breeze
flowing through the open window

sprites singing in my sleep
lead me to believe that I am invincible
doing stupid things like cooking bacon with a charger
and accidentally electrocuting a cousin

a chrysalis cut open
is like a rotting caterpillar
transformation is rooted in decay
and rebuilding on ashes

but let's not get too poetic here


three

dang it
I've got glitter in my eyes
it makes it tremendously hard to see
more distracting than rose-colored glasses

in a room full of art
I'd still stare at you
or I would, if my eyes weren't red and burning
you think you're soap, clean and beloved
but you're irritating to my sight

now I've got a migraine
fish dishwashers are insane
pulsing behind my eyes
and making my brain throb
like there's a bomb in my brain about to explode

if ghosts are real
they're having a real hoot at us now
come look at the blind stumbler
and his blue boy lover


four

when I'm right, nobody remembers
filed away in the cabinet of life
forgotten in a pile of happy moments
that should have been sorted and put up for display

when I'm wrong, nobody forgets
least of all me
we've all got to remember the cringeworthy girl from seventh grade
look, she still haunts the halls now

entropy
it will be the downfall of the universe
but you'll be the downfall of me
watching as I tumble down the mountain of fame

so when I go down
please don't whip out your phone and record me
I understand that it'll make a quick buck in ad revenue
but my insanity shouldn't be framed by a bleach commercial


five

the house has been feeling so cold recently
I don't know if it's because of your touch
your hand rests on the table beside mine
freezing the already chilled surface

maybe it's the summer storms
the thunder always rolls in at evening
maybe a god is angry that we won't stay apart
maybe he's angry at your existence

sometimes I wonder how you ended up in my household
sprawled across my doorstep with blood in your eyes
and a paper crumpled and half stained in your bruised fist
a clear sign that you had to fight to live

where did you come from, demon?
who decided that your services were displeasing?
I have a bone to pick with your boss
if you can ignite my stone cold heart
you can warm any limp green bean of a human
