***

just the right size to hold up against your chest
dim in the darkest part of the night
watching the shadows of the tree branches sway
as beyond the veil they twist and turn and play

your fingertips brush my wings absentmindedly
sitting on the couch, alone but together
feather after feather after feather

and you and I fight
tussling, disjointed wings wrapping around everywhere
a flash of fabric- I'm zipped into a bag
for a split second before I disappear and reappear elsewhere

I sit alone on a stool
staring out the dining room window at midnight
human form, human eyes, human mind
who is this person who's discarded their light?

there still remains a certain radiance to my skin
divine spirit rendered flesh, after all
but there remains an unsettling sense in that
one friend can take yet so many faces
how far one deity can fall!

you love me no matter what form I take
hanging in the air, caught in a tree
a light in the darkness
a warmth in the cold
a heft when all gravity is gone
