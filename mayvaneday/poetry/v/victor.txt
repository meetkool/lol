***

I look out on the horizon
at the fearful monsters standing halfway between the horizon and me
no longer able to be ignored and pushed off
for a future me to deal with

I prepare my weapons
a pen which I had assumed was lost
and a half-dying tablet
and prepare to meet my fate

like I'm falling into a vortex of fire
prepared to meet my doom
and yet still worse than the most cowardly
of a litter of mewling kittens

when we next meet
it shall be as victors
freedom tasting sweeter than the most sugary wine
