***

a ticket fell into my hands today
a train ride, a trip of a lifetime
to a gash wider than the crevice in my heart
severed three- no, four years ago

I turn the ticket over in my hand
a ring sounds, never stopping for four years hence
no matter how hard I try to block the number
it still finds a way to slither in

I study the stub at the end of the ticket
a siren-song of total freedom
roaming around the world- or the country, at least- in a house on
wheels
because home is where you choose it to be- everywhere and nowhere

I slip the ticket into my book as a bookmark
and close the pages and look out the window
the clouds are parting, the moon is full
and I'm ready to jump
but it's not my time yet
