					<li>Make a playlist with the songs you want in VLC.</li>
					<li>Save said playlist as an .m3u file. (Other playlist file types will not work.)</li>
					<li>Make a copy of said playlist file. Open it up in a text editor of your choice.</li>
					<li>Remove all the lines that start with "#EXTINF".</li>
					<li>Using the find-replace function, change the following strings:</li>

				<p>Whatever the path to your main music folder on your computer is, starting with "file:///", to "&#92;Music". For example, the path to my main music library is <code>file:///mnt/Hell3/Music/Music Archive/Popular</code>. (My music is sorted into "Popular", "Soundtrack", and "Vaporwave".)</p>

					<li>Change the end-of-line markers to the DOS/Windows version.</li>

				<p>Open a terminal and <code>cd</code> to the directory you saved the copy of your playlist in, then type the following:</p>
				<p><code>unix2dos playlist-copy.m3u</code></p>
				<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
					<li>Plug in your Clip Sport player. Make sure it is mounted properly (ie. not as a read-only device) before proceeding.</li>
					<li>Copy the playlist you just converted in step 6 to the "Playlists" folder, and your music to the "Music" folder.</li>
